    After graduating <%= link_to "high school", "http://www.idyllwildarts.org/" %> as a creative writing major, and spending four years at a <%= link_to "Great Books college", "http://www.sjc.edu/" %> developing a solid foundation in critical thinking and the development of Western Thought, I spent some time traveling <%= link_to "around the US", "https://www.google.com/search?q=homer,+alaska&espv=2&biw=1141&bih=578&site=webhp&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiY--O6l-nJAhUUT2MKHYfpAYoQ_AUIBygC#tbm=isch&q=hood+river+oregon" %>, meeting new people and growing in <%= link_to "diverse communities", "https://www.google.com/search?q=homer,+alaska&espv=2&biw=1141&bih=578&site=webhp&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiY--O6l-nJAhUUT2MKHYfpAYoQ_AUIBygC" %>. <br><br>

    I've long dabbled in web development and computer science, and in the fall of 2015, I started at <%= link_to "Ada Developer's Academy", "http://adadevelopersacademy.org/" %> where I'm growing and sharpening my skills as a web developer. At school, we complete <%= link_to "projects", projects_path %> using Ruby, Rails, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We use GitHub for all our projects, and regularly work on teams to get used to the git workflow and to hone our collaboration skills.<br><br>

    I look forward to using my <%= link_to "newly developed skills", projects_path %> to work on technologies that improve the world around me.
